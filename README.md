# Update Notes 0.2.4
## Gear Progression Update!
### Emblem Changes
To make gear progression more... progressive. We've simplified the Emblem system a bit. 
Emblems of Heroism drop off normal LK dungeon Bosses. Used to purchase Tier 7 Chest, Gloves, Helm and Legs
Removed Emblems of Valor, and changed the Valor Merchant to use Emblems of Heroism. Costs are slightly higher due to the increased gear level.
 Emblems of Conquest now drop from all Heroic Bosses. Used to purchase Tier 8 Chest, Gloves, Helm and Legs
 Emblems of Triumph to be rewarded for Heroic Dungeon LFG. Still drops in Raids (Ulduar, Naxx, EoE, OS, VoA). Used to purchase Tier 9
Emblem of Frost to be obtained through ICC 10/25 modes and Last boss of VoA and used to purchase Tier 10 sets.

## LFG Changes
Normal LK Dungeon LFG Queue now gives you 2 Emblems of Conquest
Heroic LK Dungeon LFG Queue now gives you 2 Emblems of Triumph

## Dungeon Changes
Forge of Souls, Pit of Saron and Halls of Reflection have been normalized! This means a full group of 4-5 will be needed to complete them. 
These dungeons drop higher gear than what is bought from the vendors with Emblems. Them being scaled for solo broke the gear progression and main the other vendors gear pretty pointless. 
Now these dungeons will act as a gear check for raids and will still drop Emblems of Triumph on each boss. 

## Emblem Vendors
Vendors in Dalaran have been updated. Emblems of Heroism are now used on 2 vendors for gear that will get you Heroic ready. 
Emblems of Conquest will offer gear that will get you Raid ready.
Emblems of Triumph will offer gear that will get you ready for ICC modes.

## Stone Shards
Removed Stone Shards from Boss drops in all LK Dungeons
Stone shards are still obtained through various quest rewards throughout the world. Specifically Wintergrasp. These vendors have remained unchanged and you can still accumulate and spend these stone shards on rewards located in Wintergrasp

## Raid Scaling
Raids have been scaled to 5 players for 10mans and 10 players for 25mans. These changes will need to be tested but I plan on setting up some possible raid nights once we get enough characters to raid level gear. 
We will start with Naxx and work our way up over time. I will send out a notification in the ⁠🔎wow-lfg channel and try to plan a weekend event soon.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed shit
